Asher, if you are reading this, know that the legacy of the Planar Order now falls to you. Seek out allies as we did—those who will form pacts with powerful beings. The Sphinx, the Great Treant, the Kirin, and the Phoenix must once again lend their strength to protect The Lyceum.

Trust in your abilities and the lessons you have learned. The fate of our world may rest on your shoulders, but you do not bear this burden alone. Gather your companions, rebuild the Order, and face the darkness that threatens us all. My hope and faith are with you.

With all my trust, Almira


Entry 1:

The Planar Order

It has been years since we, the Planar Order, swore our oaths to protect The Lyceum from the darkness that once threatened its very foundation. Our bond was forged in the fires of necessity, united by a common enemy—an old friend and colleague who chose a path of corruption and power. We once knew him as Theron, a brilliant warlock whose ambition led him to make a pact with a Dracolich, seeking power beyond mortal comprehension.

Theron's betrayal was a devastating blow. He sought to harness the power of the Nexus, the ancient source of magic hidden beneath The Lyceum. With such power, he could have reshaped the world to his twisted desires. It was then that we, four alumni bound by our love for this institution and our duty to protect it, formed the Planar Order.

To counter Theron's dark pact, each of us sought allies in the higher planes. I, Almira, pledged myself to a wise and powerful Sphinx, gaining the knowledge and arcane prowess needed to face Theron. Constance, our ever-faithful druid, made her pact with a Great Treant, embodying the strength and resilience of nature. Karlith, our devoted cleric, sought the blessing of a Kirin, a divine being of immense power and purity. And Knives, our cunning rogue, bound himself to a Phoenix, harnessing its fiery rebirth and unyielding spirit.


Entry 2:

The Battle for the Nexus

The battle that ensued was unlike anything I had ever experienced. Theron, empowered by his dark pact, was formidable. The halls of The Lyceum trembled as our magics clashed, echoing with the roars of the Dracolich and the cries of our celestial allies. Each of us played our part, drawing upon the strength and gifts bestowed by our pacts.

Constance called forth the roots and vines of the Great Treant, binding Theron's minions and creating barriers of living wood. Karlith's divine magic from the Kirin shone like a beacon, healing our wounds and banishing the shadows that Theron conjured. Knives moved with the swiftness and precision of the Phoenix, striking from the shadows and disrupting Theron's dark rituals.

As for me, the Sphinx's wisdom guided my every spell, countering Theron's dark incantations and unraveling his defenses. The climax of our battle took place in the heart of the Nexus. There, we combined our powers in a final, desperate bid to seal Theron away. Drawing upon the ancient magic of the Nexus itself, we cast him into the plane of Carceri, a prison plane from which few ever return.



Entry 3:

The Final Warning

Tonight, I received an unexpected visitor. Knives, my old comrade from the Planar Order, appeared at my door under the cover of darkness. The years had not been kind to him; his once vibrant eyes now bore the weight of countless battles and sleepless nights. As he stepped inside, the urgency in his demeanor was unmistakable.

"Almira," he began, his voice tinged with a rare strain of fear, "our allies are being hunted down. Constance and Karlith... they're gone. We are the last two left."

The shock of his words hit me like a physical blow. Constance, with her unyielding connection to nature, and Karlith, with his divine radiance—both extinguished. My heart ached at the thought of their loss, but there was no time for mourning.

Knives continued, "Theron's cult has grown. Even from his prison in Carceri, his influence seeps into our world. His followers are relentless, and he's found a way to extend his reach beyond his binding."

The implications were dire. If Theron could exert power from Carceri, the Nexus and The Lyceum were in grave danger. Knives warned me to be cautious, knowing that Theron's cult would come for us next. As we parted, the resolve in his eyes mirrored my own: we would fight to our last breath to protect what we swore to defend.

I write these words knowing that my time is short. The enemy draws near, and I must prepare Asher for what lies ahead. He is not ready, but he must become so quickly. The Planar Order must be reestablished, with four new members to take up the mantle.
